### ⚙️ What's Under the Hood? (Workflow Summary)

This flow is super neat and focused on giving you a rich conversational experience.

#### 🧩 The Core Flow, Explained Simply

1.  **The Knock:** You send a chat message, and the **`When chat message received`** node catches it.
2.  **The Brain:** Your message is zipped over to the **`AI Agent`** node—the boss of the operation!
3.  **The Magic:** The agent taps into the **`Google Gemini Chat Model`** for creative firepower and the **`Simple Memory`** node to recall your last few lines.
4.  **The Output:** The agent crafts a unique response, and it shows up in the **`Output (manual)`** node for you to see!

### 🧠 The Components That Bring SparkBot to Life

| Component | What it is | Why it's Cool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🗨️ When Chat Message Received** | The **Trigger** | It's the ear of the operation! It's always listening for your text input to kick off the fun. (P.S. You can easily swap this for Telegram or Discord later!) |
| **🤖 AI Agent** | The **Logic Unit** | This is the conductor of the orchestra. It ties the model and memory together, making sure the replies are witty, formatted beautifully (using **Markdown**), and full of personality! |
| **🧠 Google Gemini Chat Model** | The **Creative Engine** | This is why SparkBot is awesome! **Gemini excels** at open-ended, expressive chats, letting SparkBot be truly imaginative and context-aware instead of just factual. |
| **💾 Simple Memory** | The **Context Keeper** | It holds onto the last few messages. This is the secret sauce that makes your conversations feel **natural** and connected, not disjointed. |
| **📤 Output (Manual)** | The **Result Viewer** | Right now, it just displays the chat reply for testing. When you're ready, this is where you'll connect a live chat app! |
